# 1st plenary session: 07.09.2023 #


During this first Plenary session we discussed about the following topics:

* Course prerequisites
* NREC cloud

## Course prerequisites ##

In the first part of the session, we discussed some of the prerequisites for
the course, which can be summarized as follows:

* An introductory course on Operating Systems and Networks
* Basic C programming

The prerequisites mentioned above are not mandatory. However, if a student lacks
these skills, it is highly recommended to attend the plenaries/group sessions
where we will cover the necessary concepts required to complete the assignments.


We then proceeded with an interactive question-and-answer session to enable
students to self-assess their skills. You can review the results
[here](./mentisession.pdf).

## NREC cloud ##

The second plenary session was focused on NREC Cloud. During this session, we
provided a step-by-step demonstration of how to launch a virtual machine in the
cloud and access it via SSH. You can follow along with the detailed
[tutorial](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN3230/h23/hjemmeeksamen-1/running-your-vm-on-nrec.html).

## Next plenary ##

In our upcoming plenary session, we will delve into MIP, a minimal network layer
protocol essential for constructing our simple network stack as part of the
course assignments. For detailed information about MIP, please refer to its
specifications available
[here](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN3230/h23/hjemmeeksamen-1/ispec-mip-2023.txt).

Furthermore, in the following plenary session, we have an exciting live coding
session planned. During this session, we will demonstrate the development of
client/server applications utilizing UNIX and RAW sockets.


Have a nice weekend and see you next Thursday!
